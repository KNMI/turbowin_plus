created with NetBeans IDE
TurboWin+ (TurboWeb) was especially designed for running in the background eg when collecting sensor data. It can run for weeks in the background.  The memory footprint is low and the cpu usage is minimal and by using extended threading the application is always responsive. Furthermore in TurboWeb mode the app size is very small (<3 Mb).
